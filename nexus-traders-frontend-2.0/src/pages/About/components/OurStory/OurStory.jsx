          So, you guys must be wondering how we got an idea for
          &apos;Nexustraders&apos;. All founders are people who have always been
          keen on the stock market area and never thought about getting into it
          as it is known as &apos;A risky gamble&apos;. A few months before the
          pandemic, Sujoy and Hitesh were casually talking about a venture that
          would help them earn money and that&apos;s when the stock market topic
          came up. We immediately started research and started making small
          investments. But we couldn&apos;t do much like our college timings
          always collided with the market timings. But soon the pandemic hit and
          lockdown came into the scenario. It was like an opportunity presented
          itself to us and we obviously took full advantage of the situation. We
          went all in without knowing about the consequences and what was
          waiting for us! Then after a long and tiring 6 months of constant
          experience and digging knowledge from the market, we started to figure
          it out and do well for ourselves in intraday trading and swing trades.
          Hitesh had an idea that we should start teaching this to others as
          well. So boom! That&apos;s it, we had a team now. So, one night (which
          was actually 5 nights) Sujoy thought about a name and came up with
          &apos;Nexustraders&apos;. Nexus means a group or community and we
          quickly designed the logo that we agreed on. And so we became
          &apos;Nexustraders&apos;. That&apos;s our story that you didn&apos;t
          know, but now you do. So go hit that enrolls button and join us like
          these hundreds of other students who are successfully making profits
          and progress in the stock markets.
